# Node.js wpautop() 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andymantell/node-wpautop.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/andymantell/node-wpautop)

Node.js port of Wordpress' wpautop() function based on the sourcecode at http://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/src/wp-includes/formatting.php

Also contains ports of the test suite from http://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/tests/phpunit/tests/formatting/Autop.php

"Hilarious" toilet humour copied verbatim from the WordPress sourcecode. No attempt has been made to clean the function up or make it "better". This is a rough and ready port, warts and all.

Thanks goes to [@stewiem2000](https://github.com/stewiem2000) for emotional support during regular expression meltdowns.
